## Overview

Today you are going to create an account on [GitHub][] one of the better known sites for hosting [Git][] repositories. Git is a _source code management_ system – a tool to help keep track of the change in software projects, like Unity games. When things go wrong, git can help you figure out what changed, and who change it. That's the first step towards fixing it.

Here is an overview of what you will be doing today:

* Create an account on GitHub.
* Practice working with Git and GitHub.
* Turn on the [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] web site – we'll use this later to host our games.
* Configure a minimal web site.
