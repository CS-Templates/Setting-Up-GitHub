## Overview

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png" align="right"> Today you are going to create an account on [GitHub][] (contol-click on this link to open it in another tab) one of the better known sites for hosting [Git][] repositories. Git is a _source code management_ system – a tool to help keep track of the change in software projects, like Unity games. When things go wrong, git can help you figure out what changed, and who change it. That's the first step towards fixing it.

Here is an overview of what you will be doing today:

* Create an account on GitHub.
* Practice working with Git and GitHub.
* Turn on the [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] web site – we'll use this later to host our games.
* Practice by making a few changes to your website.

To finish this assignment you will need a working e-mail account that you can access. If you alread have one, that's great, use it. Otherwise, you will need to set one up. Until you verify your e-mail address, your GitHub Pages site will not be active. You can do everything else without a working e-mail.

## The Details:

Here's what to do, in detail:

### Create an account on GitHub

1. Click on the link to go to [GitHub (https://github.com)][github].
2. Select a user name that you will be comfortable sharing with colleagues and potential employers. If you can get it your name is a good choice.
3. Enter your e-mail.
4. Enter the password you want to use. You may want to type it "in the clear" so that you can be sure it is right. Note that you don't have a password verification box.
5. Once you have created the account click on the avatar in the upper right hand corner and choose Settings from the dropdown menu, then enter your name (as I know you). This is especially important if you didn't use your name as your GitHub username.
6. Then choose Profile from the same dropdown – it will take you to your GitHub profile page. Bookmark this page.

### Practice working with Git and GitHub

At the [GitHub Guides][gh-guides] site you will find a number of quick tutorials that will help you start to learn your way around Git and GitHub.

1. Read the [Understanding the GitHub Flow][gh-flow] guide.
1. Then work through the [Hello World][hello-world] guide.
1. After you have finishe the Hello World guide, click on your GitHub bookmark to return to your profile and notice that you have some new [contribution squares][gh-squares] (you should have at least five).
1. Click on your Hello World repository and you should see that you have, at least, three commits.

Congratulations, you're rolling! Next, we'll set up a website.

### Turn on GitHub Pages.

If you haven't already done so, take a minute to verify your e-mail. You will need to have it verified before your website will go live. if  you can't access your e-mail right now, don't worry continue working through the assignment and remember to get your e-mail verified before the next class.

1. Work through the [Getting Started with GitHub Pages][gh-pages] guide to enable the GitHub Pages website your account.
1. Edit your profile to add a link your GitHub Pages site.
1. Check that the link works. Remember that it can take a few minutes before your site is visible – till then you will get a 404 error.

### Practice

1. Review the GitHub [Mastering Markdown][gfm] guide, then
1. Create a new branch called `practice` in the repository for your GitHub Pages site.
1. Add a description of your game idea. If you're going to work on a team, add links to their GitHub profiles.
1. Commit your changes to see what your page will look like.
1. When your like the result, create a pull request and merge your branch back into the `master` branch. Delete the branch.
1. Check out your site!

## Submit The Assignment

When you are done, submit the assignment:

* Click on your GitHub bookmark to take you to your GitHub profile, then copy the URL.
* On Canvas (you're here, right?) paste the URL into the submission box.
* Finally in your notebook, reflect on how it went today:
  - Select the next blank page and date it and title it "Starting GitHub" would not be a bad choice of title for today.
  - What is something that "clicked" for your? Perhaps, how do you think we might use Git and GitHub on our final project?
  - Did you get stuck or lost today? Where? Do you know why?
  - What do you need to do next?
