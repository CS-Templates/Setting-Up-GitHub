## Overview

Today you are going to create an account on [GitHub][] one of the better known sites for hosting [Git][] repositories. Git is a _source code management_ system – a tool to help keep track of the change in software projects, like Unity games. When things go wrong, git can help you figure out what changed, and who change it. That's the first step towards fixing it.

Here is an overview of what you will be doing today:

* Create an account on GitHub.
* Practice working with Git and GitHub.
* Turn on the [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] web site – we'll use this later to host our games.
* Practice by making a few changes to your website.

To finish this assignment you will need a working e-mail account that you can access. If you alread have one, that's great, use it. Otherwise, you will need to set one up. Until you verify your e-mail address, your GitHub Pages site will not be active. You can do everything else without a working e-mail.

## The Details:

Here's what to do, in detail:

### Create an account on GitHub

1. Click on the link to go to [GitHub (https://github.com)][github].
2. Select a user name that you will be comfortable sharing with colleagues and potential employers. If you can get it your name is a good choice.
3. Enter your e-mail.
4. Enter the password you want to use. You may want to type it "in the clear" so that you can be sure it is right. Note that you don't have a password verification box.
5. Once you have created the account click on the avatar in the upper right hand corner and choose Settings from the dropdown menu, then enter your name (as I know you). This is especially important if you didn't use your name as your GitHub username.
6. Then choose Profile from the same dropdown – it will take you to your GitHub profile page. Bookmark this page.

### Practice working with Git and GitHub

At the [GitHub Guides][gh-guides] site you will find a number of quick tutorials that will help you start to learn your way around Git and GitHub.

1. Read the [Understanding the GitHub Flow][gh-flow] guide.
1. Then work through the [Hello World][hello-world] guide.
1. After you have finishe the Hello World guide, click on your GitHub bookmark to return to your profile and notice that you have some new [contribution squares][gh-squares] (you should have at least five).
1. Click on your Hello World repository and you should see that you have, at least, three commits.

Congratulations, you're rolling! Next, we'll set up a website.

### Turn on GitHub Pages.

1. Work through the [Getting Started with GitHub Pages][gh-pages] guide to enable the GitHub Pages website your account.
1. Edit your profile to add a link your GitHub Pages site.
